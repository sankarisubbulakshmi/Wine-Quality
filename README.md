# Wine Quality Dataset
## Overview
This dataset contains information about red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 
It includes various physicochemical properties of the wines and their quality ratings. 

### Column Names and Details
The dataset contains the following columns for both red and white wine datasets:

fixed acidity: Fixed acidity of the wine, measured in g/dm³.
volatile acidity: Volatile acidity of the wine, measured in g/dm³.
citric acid: Citric acid content in the wine, measured in g/dm³.
residual sugar: Residual sugar content in the wine, measured in g/dm³.
chlorides: Chloride content in the wine, measured in g/dm³.
free sulfur dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide content in the wine, measured in mg/dm³.
total sulfur dioxide: Total sulfur dioxide content in the wine, measured in mg/dm³.
density: Density of the wine, measured in g/cm³.
pH: pH level of the wine.
sulphates: Sulphate content in the wine, measured in g/dm³.
alcohol: Alcohol content in the wine, measured in % by volume.
quality: Quality score of the wine, ranging from 0 to 10.
